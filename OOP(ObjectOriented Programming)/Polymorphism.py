# common interface
# to use the polymorphism, we have created a common interface
# flying_test() function calls any object and calls the object's fly() method.
def flying_test(bird):
    bird.fly()


# instantiate objects
blu = Parrot()
peggy = Penguin()

# passing the object
flying_test(blu)
flying_test(peggy)
